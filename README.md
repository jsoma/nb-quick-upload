# nb-quick-upload

Upload Jupyter notebooks as gists quickly and easily. And if you don't want to upload the entire thing? NO PROBLEM. Just upload a few cells!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jsoma/nb-quick-upload.git
jupyter nbextension install nb-quick-upload --user
jupyter nbextension enable nb-quick-upload/main
```

When you're in your notebooks you'll have a brand-new icon, a little generic cloud-upload thingy. Use it to get rolling with your uploading.
